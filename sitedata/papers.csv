jiang2020prioritized,Prioritized Level Replay,Minqi Jiang|Edward Grefenstette|Tim Rocktäschel,"Simulated environments with procedurally generated content have become popular benchmarks for testing systematic generalization of reinforcement learning agents. Every level in such an environment is algorithmically created, thereby exhibiting a unique configuration of underlying factors of variation, such as layout, positions of entities, asset appearances, or even the rules governing environment transitions. Fixed sets of training levels can be determined to aid comparison and reproducibility, and test levels can be held out to evaluate the generalization and robustness of agents. While prior work samples training levels in a direct way (e.g. uniformly) for the agent to learn from, we investigate the hypothesis that different levels provide different learning progress for an agent at specific times during training. We introduce Prioritized Level Replay, a general framework for estimating the future learning potential of a level given the current state of the agent's policy. We find that temporal-difference (TD) errors, while previously used to selectively sample past transitions, also prove effective for scoring a level's future learning potential when the agent replays (that is, revisits) that level to generate entirely new episodes of experiences from it. We report significantly improved sample-efficiency and generalization on the majority of Procgen Benchmark environments as well as two challenging MiniGrid environments. Lastly, we present a qualitative analysis showing that Prioritized Level Replay induces an implicit curriculum, taking the agent gradually from easier to harder levels",reinforcement learning|curriculum learning|generalization|procedural content generation,ICML,2021,Conference,https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03934
jiang2021gtg, Grid-to-Graph: Flexible Spatial Relational Inductive Biases for Reinforcement Learning,Zhengyao Jiang|Pasquale Minervini|Minqi Jiang|Tim Rocktaschel,"Although reinforcement learning has been successfully applied in many domains in recent years, we still lack agents that can systematically generalize. While relational inductive biases that fit a task can improve generalization of RL agents, these biases are commonly hard-coded directly in the agent's neural architecture. In this work, we show that we can incorporate relational inductive biases, encoded in the form of relational graphs, into agents. Based on this insight, we propose Grid-to-Graph (GTG), a mapping from grid structures to relational graphs that carry useful spatial relational inductive biases when processed through a Relational Graph Convolution Network (R-GCN). We show that, with GTG, R-GCNs generalize better both in terms of in-distribution and out-of-distribution compared to baselines based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Neural Logic Machines on challenging procedurally generated environments and MinAtar. Furthermore, we show that GTG produces agents that can jointly reason over observations and environment dynamics encoded in knowledge bases.",Relational Inductive Bias|Reinforcement Learning|Graph Neural Network,AAMAS,2021,Conference,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04220
campero2021amigo,Learning with AMIGo: Adversarially Motivated Intrinsic Goals,Andres Campero|Roberta Raileanu|Heinrich Küttler|Joshua B. Tenenbaum|Tim Rocktäschel|Edward Grefenstette,"A key challenge for reinforcement learning (RL) consists of learning in environments with sparse extrinsic rewards. In contrast to current RL methods, humans are able to learn new skills with little or no reward by using various forms of intrinsic motivation. We propose AMIGo, a novel agent incorporating a goal-generating teacher that proposes Adversarially Motivated Intrinsic Goals to train a goal-conditioned 'student' policy in the absence of (or alongside) environment reward. Specifically, through a simple but effective 'constructively adversarial' objective, the teacher learns to propose increasingly challenging—yet achievable—goals that allow the student to learn general skills for acting in a new environment, independent of the task to be solved. We show that our method generates a natural curriculum of self-proposed goals which ultimately allows the agent to solve challenging procedurally-generated tasks where other forms of intrinsic motivation and state-of-the-art RL methods fail.",exploration|reinforcement learning,ICLR,2021,Conference,https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12122
arakelyan2021cqd,Complex Query Answering with Neural Link Predictors,Erik Arakelyan|Daniel Daza|Pasquale Minervini|Michael Cochez,"Neural link predictors are immensely useful for identifying missing edges in large scale Knowledge Graphs. However, it is still not clear how to use these models for answering more complex queries that arise in a number of domains, such as queries using logical conjunctions (∧), disjunctions (∨) and existential quantifiers (∃), while accounting for missing edges. In this work, we propose a framework for efficiently answering complex queries on incomplete Knowledge Graphs. We translate each query into an end-to-end differentiable objective, where the truth value of each atom is computed by a pre-trained neural link predictor. We then analyse two solutions to the optimisation problem, including gradient-based and combinatorial search. In our experiments, the proposed approach produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods -- black-box neural models trained on millions of generated queries -- without the need of training on a large and diverse set of complex queries. Using orders of magnitude less training data, we obtain relative improvements ranging from 8% up to 40% in Hits@3 across different knowledge graphs containing factual information. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to explain the outcome of our model in terms of the intermediate solutions identified for each of the complex query atoms. All our source code and datasets are available online.",complex query answering|Knowledge Graphs,ICLR,2021 (Outstanding Paper Award),Conference,https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03459
kuettler2020nethack,The NetHack Learning Environment,Heinrich Küttler|Nantas Nardelli|Alexander H. Miller|Roberta Raileanu|Marco Selvatici|Edward Grefenstette|Tim Rocktäschel,"Progress in Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms goes hand-in-hand with the development of challenging environments that test the limits of current methods. While existing RL environments are either sufficiently complex or based on fast simulation, they are rarely both. Here, we present the NetHack Learning Environment (NLE), a scalable, procedurally generated, stochastic, rich, and challenging environment for RL research based on the popular single-player terminal-based roguelike game, NetHack. We argue that NetHack is sufficiently complex to drive long-term research on problems such as exploration, planning, skill acquisition, and language-conditioned RL, while dramatically reducing the computational resources required to gather a large amount of experience. We compare NLE and its task suite to existing alternatives, and discuss why it is an ideal medium for testing the robustness and systematic generalization of RL agents. We demonstrate empirical success for early stages of the game using a distributed Deep RL baseline and Random Network Distillation exploration, alongside qualitative analysis of various agents trained in the environment. NLE is open source at https://github.com/facebookresearch/nle.",environment|reinforcement learning,NeurIPS,2020,Conference,https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13760
jiang2020wordcraft,WordCraft: An Environment for Benchmarking Commonsense Agents,Minqi Jiang|Jelena Luketina|Nantas Nardelli|Pasquale Minervini|Philip H.S. Torr|Shimon Whiteson|Tim Rocktäschel,"The ability to quickly solve a wide range of real-world tasks requires a commonsense understanding of the world. Yet, how to best extract such knowledge from natural language corpora and integrate it with reinforcement learning (RL) agents remains an open challenge. This is partly due to the lack of lightweight simulation environments that sufficiently reflect the semantics of the real world and provide knowledge sources grounded with respect to observations in an RL environment. To better enable research on agents making use of commonsense knowledge, we propose WordCraft, an RL environment based on Little Alchemy 2. This lightweight environment is fast to run and built upon entities and relations inspired by real-world semantics. We evaluate several representation learning methods on this new benchmark and propose a new method for integrating knowledge graphs with an RL agent.",reinforcement learning|commonsense reasoning|natural language processing|procedural content generation,Workshop on Language in Reinforcement Learning at ICML,2020,Conference,https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09185
raileanu2020ride,RIDE: Rewarding Impact-Driven Exploration for Procedurally-Generated Environments,Roberta Raileanu|Tim Rocktäschel,"Exploration in sparse reward environments remains one of the key challenges of model-free reinforcement learning. Instead of solely relying on extrinsic rewards provided by the environment, many state-of-the-art methods use intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. However, we show that existing methods fall short in procedurally-generated environments where an agent is unlikely to visit a state more than once. We propose a novel type of intrinsic reward which encourages the agent to take actions that lead to significant changes in its learned state representation. We evaluate our method on multiple challenging procedurally-generated tasks in MiniGrid, as well as on tasks with high-dimensional observations used in prior work. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach is more sample efficient than existing exploration methods, particularly for procedurally-generated MiniGrid environments. Furthermore, we analyze the learned behavior as well as the intrinsic reward received by our agent. In contrast to previous approaches, our intrinsic reward does not diminish during the course of training and it rewards the agent substantially more for interacting with objects that it can control.",exploration|reinforcement learning,ICLR,2020,Conference,https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12292.abs
zhong2020rtfm,RTFM: Generalising to New Environment Dynamics via Reading,Victor Zhong|Tim Rocktäschel|Edward Grefenstette,"Obtaining policies that can generalise to new environments in reinforcement learning is challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that language understanding via a reading policy learner is a promising vehicle for generalisation to new environments. We propose a grounded policy learning problem, Read to Fight Monsters (RTFM), in which the agent must jointly reason over a language goal, relevant dynamics described in a document, and environment observations. We procedurally generate environment dynamics and corresponding language descriptions of the dynamics, such that agents must read to understand new environment dynamics instead of memorising any particular information. In addition, we propose txt2π, a model that captures three-way interactions between the goal, document, and observations. On RTFM, txt2π generalises to new environments with dynamics not seen during training via reading. Furthermore, our model outperforms baselines such as FiLM and language-conditioned CNNs on RTFM. Through curriculum learning, txt2π produces policies that excel on complex RTFM tasks requiring several reasoning and coreference steps.",natural language processing|reasoning|reinforcement learning,ICLR,2020,Conference,https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08210
mahajan2021tesseract,Tesseract: Tensorised Actors for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,Anuj Mahajan|Mikayel Samvelyan|Lei Mao|Viktor Makoviychuk|Animesh Garg|Jean Kossaifi|Shimon Whiteson|Yuke Zhu|Animashree Anandkumar,"Reinforcement Learning in large action spaces is a challenging problem. Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) exacerbates matters by imposing various constraints on communication and observability. In this work, we consider the fundamental hurdle affecting both value-based and policy-gradient approaches: an exponential blowup of the action space with the number of agents. For value-based methods, it poses challenges in accurately representing the optimal value function. For policy gradient methods, it makes training the critic difficult and exacerbates the problem of the lagging critic. We show that from a learning theory perspective, both problems can be addressed by accurately representing the associated action-value function with a low-complexity hypothesis class. This requires accurately modelling the agent interactions in a sample efficient way. To this end, we propose a novel tensorised formulation of the Bellman equation. This gives rise to our method Tesseract, which views the Q-function as a tensor whose modes correspond to the action spaces of different agents. Algorithms derived from Tesseract decompose the Q-tensor across agents and utilise low-rank tensor approximations to model agent interactions relevant to the task. We provide PAC analysis for Tesseract-based algorithms and highlight their relevance to the class of rich observation MDPs. Empirical results in different domains confirm Tesseract's gains in sample efficiency predicted by the theory.",reinforcement learning|multi-agent learning,ICML,2021,Conference,https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00136
