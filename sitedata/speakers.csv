While its most ambitious potential is far from being realized, conceptual and algorithmic progress has been made. I will review progress in open-ended search and highlight open challenges.","Joel Lehman is a research scientist at OpenAI, and previously was a founding member of Uber AI Labs and an assistant professor at the IT University of Copenhagen. His research focuses on open-endedness, reinforcement learning, evolutionary computation, and AI safety. His PhD dissertation introduced novelty search, an influential method within evolutionary computation, which inspired a popular science book co-written with Ken Stanley on what search algorithms imply for individual and societal objectives, called “Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned.”"
