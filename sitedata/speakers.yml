  abstract: "As interest in the field of open-endedness expands, ideas like continual discovery and increasingly complexity have gained significant attention. The aim of this talk is to bring attention to two lesser-known facets of open-endedness that nevertheless merit significantly more attention. First, evidence so far suggests that representations achieved through open-ended processes seem radically different from representations discovered through optimization, even if they solve the same problem. The implications of this observation are unknown but potentially significant. Second, while the agents themselves in an open-ended system are of course critical, in processes analogous to civilization (as opposed to evolution), the artifacts those agents put into and leave in the environment (e.g. houses and cars for humans) are also critical to the trajectory of the system, yet little studied or understood. New advances, such as Evolution through Large Models, make studying this issue more feasible. The hope is that this talk will inspire further investigation into both considerations."

  date: March 24, 2022
  abstract: "While there has been major investment in developing robot learning algorithms, achieving true autonomy remains a wide-open research question. A key limitation of current learning approaches is the assumption that learning is a one-time event on a pre-defined task-distribution and that an expert can manually specify how a robot should learn these tasks from multi-modal sensor data. This approach to setting up the learning problem fundamentally hinders robots from being able to learn new tasks or adapt to new situations autonomously. In this talk, I will discuss the challenges of the frontier of a lifelong learning robot and what algorithmic advancements are required to advance the state-of-the-art in autonomous robotics. In short, progress towards lifelong learning robots requires algorithms that enable a robot to learn new skills incrementally and continuously (without forgetting), autonomously (without expert intervention) and sample-efficiently. In this context, I will present our recent advances towards autonomous learning of robotic manipulation skills by enabling the robot to learn reward functions while only requiring minimal expert intervention. Specifically, I will present a unified framework for model-based and model-free reward learning algorithms, that can either learn rewards from demonstrations or under-specified (sparse) rewards.  Finally, I will discuss the challenge of learning rewards that generalize to novel settings, and present initial insights from our empirical analysis of how well learned rewards generalize."

  abstract: "The capabilities of modern machine learning systems are to a large extent determined by their ability to effectively utilize large and diverse datasets. However, such systems typically focus on making predictions rather than making decisions, with the aim of maximizing the likelihood of some data rather than a user-specified utility function. Reinforcement learning methods directly address the problem of utility maximization, but such methods are difficult to reconcile with modern data-driven learning, and typically require either active data collection or specially tailored datasets, both of which are not conducive for being able to use large datasets. In this talk, I will discuss how learning-based control can be performed with offline data, and how such offline RL algorithms can utilize comparatively less specialized datasets with general-purpose objectives to enable learning to make decisions at scale. I will discuss the algorithmic foundations of offline reinforcement learning, and present a number of robotics applications that use comparatively general data sources in the areas of robotic navigation and manipulation."

  abstract: "The world around us — and our understanding of it — is rich in compositional structure: from atoms and their interactions to objects and entities in our environments. How can we learn models of the world that take this structure into account and generalize to new compositions in systematic ways? This talk focuses on an emerging class of slot-based neural architectures that can discover, represent, and reason about abstract entities from perceptual input alone. Taking our recent work on Slot Attention as an example, I will explain the challenges for object discovery and how attention-based routing provides an elegant solution to mapping from low-level perceptual features to high-level object-centric abstractions. With Slot Attention for Video (SAVi), we extend this framework to temporally-consistent modeling of objects over time and show how information about object motion can help the model find the right decomposition of a scene into its constituent components. Finally, I will discuss some of the open challenges that remain for developing and deploying structured world models."

  abstract: "Recently there has been a shift in computer vision research from static vision, e.g., object detection, to Embodied AI, e.g., robot navigation. In this talk, I will focus on the task of PointGoal navigation (PointNav) where an embodied agent (virtual robot) is tasked with navigating to a point specified relative to its initial location in an unknown environment and without a map. I will ask and answer: Given only a depth camera and localization sensor, is this task learnable with generic tools, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) and generic neural networks? To answer this question, my collaborators and I developed a new distributed system for RL designed to meet the needs of training in realistic simulation. We showed that this task is entirely learnable by training an agent for the equivalent of 80 years of human experience. We then designed a new simulation paradigm specifically for the needs of RL centered on large batch simulation, where the simulator simulates many agents in many environments at once and is responsible for its own parallelization, reducing training wall-clock time from 6 GPU months to 36 GPU hours, an over 100x improvement."

In this talk I will share insights recently developed by my team and myself on how reinforcement learning, and other AI techniques can give rise to more human-like bot or NPC behaviors, focusing on the following components. First, I motivate the need for accurately evaluating human-likeness, propose a solution within a single-agent navigation task, and show that achieving highly skilled behavior is insufficient for human-likeness. Second, I demonstrate the first agent that passes our bar for human-likeness.

  abstract: "Video games have become an attractive testbed for evaluating AI systems, by capturing some aspects of real-world complexity (rich visual stimuli and non-trivial decision policies) while abstracting away from other sources of complexity (e.g., sensory transduction and motor planning). Some AI researchers have reported human-level performance of their systems, but we still have very little insight into how humans actually learn to play video games. This talk will present new data on human video game learning indicating that humans learn very differently from most current AI systems, particularly those based on deep learning. Humans can induce object-oriented, relational models from a small amount of experience, which allow them to learn quickly, explore intelligently, plan efficiently, and generalize flexibly. These aspects of human-like learning can be captured by a model that learns through a form of program induction."

  abstract: "The benefit of multi-task learning over single-task learning relies on the ability to use relations across tasks to improve performance on any single task. While sharing representations is an important mechanism to share information across tasks, its success depends on how well the structure underlying the tasks is captured. In some real-world situations, we have access to metadata, or additional information about a task, that may not provide any new insight in the context of a single task setup alone but inform relations across multiple tasks. While this metadata can be useful for improving multi-task learning performance, effectively incorporating it can be an additional challenge. In this talk, we explore various ways to utilize context to improve positive transfer in multi-task reinforcement learning."

  date: May 24, 2021
  abstract: "In this talk, I'll give four good reasons to do embodied machine learning. Learning in an agent that can perceive and interact with its environment is fundamentally different from other ML settings. Unlike a disembodied model, an embodied learner must learn to perceive and move in addition to mastering whatever specific behaviour the user may be interested in. This may seem like a disadvantage, because there is in some sense more to learn, but it can also be an advantage when trying to replicate human cognitive behaviours like reasoning and generalization. Having a body and being necessarily located at a specific place at a given time places strong constraints on the learner's experience, which in turn leads to more human-like learning outcomes. These results suggest that embodied learning may be an important part of what is needed to convincingly replicate human linguistic intuitions and behaviours in a machine."

In artificial intelligence, the last few years have seen the development of model-based deep reinforcement learning methods, which seemingly share many similarities with mental simulation. In this talk, I will discuss how closely such methods actually capture the qualitative characteristics exhibited by human mental simulation, with a particular focus on: (1) the extent to which the performance of such agents is driven by model-based reasoning and planning, and (2) how effectively such agents can leverage planning for generalization. While a number of challenges remain in matching the capacity of human mental simulation, I will highlight some recent progress on developing more compositional model-based algorithms through the use of graph neural networks and tree search.'

  abstract: In recent years we have seen rapid progress on a number of zero-sum benchmark problems in artificial intelligence, e.g. Go, Poker and Dota. In contrast to these competitive settings, success in the real world typically requires humans, and will require AI agents, to cooperate, communicate and coordinate with others. Crucially, from a learning point of view, these three Cs require fundamentally novel approaches, methods and theory, which has been at the heart of my research agenda. In my talk I will cover recent progress, including how agents can learn to entice others to cooperate in settings of conflicting goals by accounting for their learning behaviour, how they can learn to communicate by reasoning over (public) beliefs and how they can learn policies that can coordinate with other agents at test time by exploiting the symmetries in the environment. I will finish the talk by outlining some of the promising directions for future work.

  speaker: Jacob Andreas
  institution: MIT
  date: Mar 01, 2021
  abstract: Central to tasks like instruction following and question answering is the ability to ground linguistic understanding in perception and action. Machine learning models for these tasks typically rely on grounded supervision, e.g. actions paired with human-generated instructions or images paired with human-generated questions and answers. Indeed, several recent papers have argued that general-purpose language understanding (even in text-only tasks like machine reading and text generation) is impossible without grounding. In this talk, I'll present two studies on improving grounded language learning without grounded supervision. First, I'll describe an approach for using multi-agent interaction to fine-tune models for instruction following and instruction generation---without additional human-generated text. Next, I'll describe some very recent work suggesting that language models trained on text alone---without any grounding---are capable of building implicit world models and simulating interactions between entities described in discourse.

  abstract: Neural language models, as they grow in scale, continue to surprise us with utterly nonsensical and counterintuitive errors despite their otherwise remarkable performances on leaderboards. In this talk, I will argue that it is time to challenge the currently dominant paradigm of task-specific supervision built on top of large-scale self-supervised neural networks. I will first highlight how we can make better lemonade out of neural language models by shifting our focus on unsupervised, inference-time algorithms. I will demonstrate how unsupervised algorithms can match or even outperform supervised approaches on hard reasoning tasks such as nonmonotonic reasoning (such as counterfactual and abductive reasoning), or complex language generation tasks that require logical constraints. Next, I will highlight the importance of melding explicit and declarative knowledge encoded in symbolic knowledge graphs with implicit and observed knowledge encoded in neural language models. I will present COMET, Commonsense Transformers that learn neural representation of commonsense reasoning from a symbolic commonsense knowledge graph, and Social Chemistry 101, a new conceptual formalism, a knowledge graph, and neural models to reason about social, moral, and ethical norms.

  abstract: Social learning helps humans and animals rapidly adapt to new circumstances, and drives the emergence of complex learned behaviors. This talk focuses on Social Reinforcement Learning, developing new RL algorithms that leverage social learning to improve single-agent learning and generalization, multi-agent coordination, and human-AI interaction. We will demonstrate how a multi-agent technique for Adversarial Environment Generation based on minimax regret can lead to the generation of a complex curriculum of training environments, which improves an agent’s zero-shot transfer to unknown, single-agent test tasks. To improve multi-agent coordination, we give agents an intrinsic motivation to increase their causal influence over the actions of other agents, and show that this leads to the emergence of communication and enhances cooperation. Finally, we propose a novel Offline RL technique for learning from intrinsic social cues during interaction with humans in an open-domain dialog setting. Together, this work argues that Social RL is a valuable approach for developing more general, sophisticated, and human-compatible AI.

  abstract: Researchers in open-ended machine learning are inspired by natural and human processes of innovation (like biological evolution or science itself), and aim to uncover the engineering principles underlying boundlessly creative search algorithms, i.e. algorithms capable of continual production of useful and interesting innovations, The speculative promise for machine learning from such open-ended search includes automated discovery of curricula for reinforcement learning, new neural architectures, and most ambitiously, AGI itself. While its most ambitious potential is far from being realized, conceptual and algorithmic progress has been made. I will review progress in open-ended search and highlight open challenges.
  bio: Joel Lehman is a research scientist at OpenAI, and previously was a founding member of Uber AI Labs and an assistant professor at the IT University of Copenhagen. His research focuses on open-endedness, reinforcement learning, evolutionary computation, and AI safety. His PhD dissertation introduced novelty search, an influential method within evolutionary computation, which inspired a popular science book co-written with Ken Stanley on what search algorithms imply for individual and societal objectives, called “Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned.”
