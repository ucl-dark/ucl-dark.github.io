- title: On Question Answering on Images and Databases
  speaker: Dzmitry Bahdanau
  institution: McGill University
  date: Mar 15, 2021
  abstract: The AI's ability to answer questions that are grounded in context is interesting from both academic and practical perspectives. In this talk, I will present two projects that study question answering (QA) in visual and symbolic database context respectively. In the first project my collaborators and I show that a neuro-symbolic visual QA system can learn variable bindings from the top-down QA training signal only. The system successfully learns both conventional bindings (e.g. objects) and less trivial ones (e.g. groups). In our second project my colleagues at Element AI and I explore text2sql systems for answering questions about databases. We perform extensive ablation testing to understand what is really necessary for such systems to achieve best performance. I will end the talk with a quick preview of our on-going few-shot text2sql research efforts.

- title: Learning to Cooperate, Communicate and Coordinate
  speaker: Jakob Foerster
  institution: Facebook AI Research
  date: Mar 08, 2021
  abstract: In recent years we have seen rapid progress on a number of zero-sum benchmark problems in artificial intelligence, e.g. Go, Poker and Dota. In contrast to these competitive settings, success in the real world typically requires humans, and will require AI agents, to cooperate, communicate and coordinate with others. Crucially, from a learning point of view, these three Cs require fundamentally novel approaches, methods and theory, which has been at the heart of my research agenda. In my talk I will cover recent progress, including how agents can learn to entice others to cooperate in settings of conflicting goals by accounting for their learning behaviour, how they can learn to communicate by reasoning over (public) beliefs and how they can learn policies that can coordinate with other agents at test time by exploiting the symmetries in the environment. I will finish the talk by outlining some of the promising directions for future work.

- title: Grounded Language Learning Without Grounded Supervision
  speaker: Jacob Andreas
  institution: MIT
  date: Mar 01, 2021
  abstract: Central to tasks like instruction following and question answering is the ability to ground linguistic understanding in perception and action. Machine learning models for these tasks typically rely on grounded supervision, e.g. actions paired with human-generated instructions or images paired with human-generated questions and answers. Indeed, several recent papers have argued that general-purpose language understanding (even in text-only tasks like machine reading and text generation) is impossible without grounding. In this talk, I'll present two studies on improving grounded language learning without grounded supervision. First, I'll describe an approach for using multi-agent interaction to fine-tune models for instruction following and instruction generation---without additional human-generated text. Next, I'll describe some very recent work suggesting that language models trained on text alone---without any grounding---are capable of building implicit world models and simulating interactions between entities described in discourse.

- title: Intuitive Reasoning as (Un)supervised Neural Generation
  speaker: Yejin Choi
  institution: University of Washington
  date: Jan 04, 2021
  abstract: Neural language models, as they grow in scale, continue to surprise us with utterly nonsensical and counterintuitive errors despite their otherwise remarkable performances on leaderboards. In this talk, I will argue that it is time to challenge the currently dominant paradigm of task-specific supervision built on top of large-scale self-supervised neural networks. I will first highlight how we can make better lemonade out of neural language models by shifting our focus on unsupervised, inference-time algorithms. I will demonstrate how unsupervised algorithms can match or even outperform supervised approaches on hard reasoning tasks such as nonmonotonic reasoning (such as counterfactual and abductive reasoning), or complex language generation tasks that require logical constraints. Next, I will highlight the importance of melding explicit and declarative knowledge encoded in symbolic knowledge graphs with implicit and observed knowledge encoded in neural language models. I will present COMET, Commonsense Transformers that learn neural representation of commonsense reasoning from a symbolic commonsense knowledge graph, and Social Chemistry 101, a new conceptual formalism, a knowledge graph, and neural models to reason about social, moral, and ethical norms.

- title: Social Reinforcement Learning
  speaker: Natasha Jaques
  institution: Google Brain
  date: Dec 21, 2020
  abstract: Social learning helps humans and animals rapidly adapt to new circumstances, and drives the emergence of complex learned behaviors. This talk focuses on Social Reinforcement Learning, developing new RL algorithms that leverage social learning to improve single-agent learning and generalization, multi-agent coordination, and human-AI interaction. We will demonstrate how a multi-agent technique for Adversarial Environment Generation based on minimax regret can lead to the generation of a complex curriculum of training environments, which improves an agent’s zero-shot transfer to unknown, single-agent test tasks. To improve multi-agent coordination, we give agents an intrinsic motivation to increase their causal influence over the actions of other agents, and show that this leads to the emergence of communication and enhances cooperation. Finally, we propose a novel Offline RL technique for learning from intrinsic social cues during interaction with humans in an open-domain dialog setting. Together, this work argues that Social RL is a valuable approach for developing more general, sophisticated, and human-compatible AI.

- title: Promise, Progress, and Challenges in Open-Ended Machine Learning
  speaker: Joel Lehman
  institution: OpenAI
  date: Nov 23, 2020
  abstract: Researchers in open-ended machine learning are inspired by natural and human processes of innovation (like biological evolution or science itself), and aim to uncover the engineering principles underlying boundlessly creative search algorithms, i.e. algorithms capable of continual production of useful and interesting innovations, The speculative promise for machine learning from such open-ended search includes automated discovery of curricula for reinforcement learning, new neural architectures, and most ambitiously, AGI itself. While its most ambitious potential is far from being realized, conceptual and algorithmic progress has been made. I will review progress in open-ended search and highlight open challenges.
  bio: Joel Lehman is a research scientist at OpenAI, and previously was a founding member of Uber AI Labs and an assistant professor at the IT University of Copenhagen.
