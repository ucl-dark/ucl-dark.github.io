[{"UID":"samvelyan2024rainbow","abstract":"As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent across many real-world applications, understanding and enhancing their robustness to adversarial attacks is of paramount importance. Existing methods for identifying adversarial prompts tend to focus on specific domains, lack diversity, or require extensive human annotations. To address these limitations, we present Rainbow Teaming, a novel black-box approach for producing a diverse collection of adversarial prompts. Rainbow Teaming casts adversarial prompt generation as a quality-diversity problem, and uses open-ended search to generate prompts that are both effective and diverse. Focusing on the safety domain, we use Rainbow Teaming to target various state-of-the-art LLMs, including the Llama 2 and Llama 3 models. Our approach reveals hundreds of effective adversarial prompts, with an attack success rate exceeding 90% across all tested models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prompts generated by Rainbow Teaming are highly transferable and that fine-tuning models with synthetic data generated by our method significantly enhances their safety without sacrificing general performance or helpfulness. We additionally explore the versatility of Rainbow Teaming by applying it to question answering and cybersecurity, showcasing its potential to drive robust open-ended self-improvement in a wide range of applications.","authors":"Mikayel Samvelyan|Sharath Chandra Raparthy|Andrei Lupu|Eric Hambro|Aram H.

The daunting challenges in this field stem from the difficulty of optimizing in high-dimensional action spaces and the instability introduced by the bipedal morphology of humanoids. However, the extensive collection of human motion-captured data and the derived datasets of humanoid trajectories, such as MoCapAct, paves the way to tackle these challenges. In this context, we present Humanoid Generalist Autoencoding Planner (H-GAP), a state-action trajectory generative model trained on humanoid trajectories derived from human motion-captured data, capable of adeptly handling downstream control tasks with Model Predictive Control (MPC). For 56 degrees of freedom humanoid, we empirically demonstrate that H-GAP learns to represent and generate a wide range of motor behaviours. Further, without any learning from online interactions, it can also flexibly transfer these behaviors to solve novel downstream control tasks via planning. Notably, H-GAP excels established MPC baselines that have access to the ground truth dynamics model, and is superior or comparable to offline RL methods trained for individual tasks.

We further analyse the reasons for this performance boost through a novel visualisation of the transition graphs of Atari games.","authors":"Zhengyao Jiang|Tianjun Zhang|Robert Kirk|Tim Rockt\u00e4schel|Edward Grefenstette","keywords":"reinforcement learning|graph structure|data-efficient RL","proceedings":"arXiv","title":"Graph Backup: Data Efficient Backup Exploiting Markovian Transitions","type":"Preprint","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15824","year":2022},{"UID":"parker-holder2022evolving","abstract":"It remains a significant challenge to train generally capable agents with reinforcement learning (RL). A promising avenue for improving the robustness of RL agents is through the use of curricula. One such class of methods frames environment design as a game between a student and a teacher, using regret-based objectives to produce environment instantiations (or levels) at the frontier of the student agent's capabilities. These methods benefit from their generality, with theoretical guarantees at equilibrium, yet they often struggle to find effective levels in challenging design spaces. By contrast, evolutionary approaches seek to incrementally alter environment complexity, resulting in potentially open-ended learning, but often rely on domain-specific heuristics and vast amounts of computational resources. In this paper we propose to harness the power of evolution in a principled, regret-based curriculum. Our approach, which we call Adversarially Compounding Complexity by Editing Levels (ACCEL), seeks to constantly produce levels at the frontier of an agent's capabilities, resulting in curricula that start simple but become increasingly complex. ACCEL maintains the theoretical benefits of prior regret-based methods, while providing significant empirical gains in a diverse set of environments.

From simple organisations in an ant colony to complex systems in human groups, collective intelligence is vital for solving complex survival tasks. As is commonly observed, such natural systems are flexible to changes in their structure. Specifically, they exhibit a high degree of generalization when the abilities or the total number of agents changes within a system. We term this phenomenon as Combinatorial Generalization (CG). CG is a highly desirable trait for autonomous systems as it can increase their utility and deployability across a wide range of applications. While recent works addressing specific aspects of CG have shown impressive results on complex domains, they provide no performance guarantees when generalizing towards novel situations. In this work, we shed light on the theoretical underpinnings of CG for cooperative multi-agent systems (MAS). Specifically, we study generalization bounds under a linear dependence of the underlying dynamics on the agent capabilities, which can be seen as a generalization of Successor Features to MAS. We then extend the results first for Lipschitz and then arbitrary dependence of rewards on team capabilities. Finally, empirical analysis on various domains using the framework of multi-agent reinforcement learning highlights important desiderata for multi-agent algorithms towards ensuring CG.","authors":"Anuj Mahajan|Mikayel Samvelyan|Tarun Gupta|Benjamin Ellis|Mingfei Sun|Tim Rockt\u00e4schel|Shimon Whiteson","keywords":"reinforcement learning|multi-agent|generalization","proceedings":"arXiv","title":"Generalization in Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems","type":"Preprint","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00104","year":2022},{"UID":"kirk2021survey","abstract":"The study of zero-shot generalisation (ZSG) in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to produce RL algorithms whose policies generalise well to novel unseen situations at deployment time, avoiding overfitting to their training environments.

Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) is a promising self-supervised RL paradigm, wherein the free parameters of an underspecified environment are automatically adapted during training to the agent's capabilities, leading to the emergence of diverse training environments. Here, we cast Prioritized Level Replay (PLR), an empirically successful but theoretically unmotivated method that selectively samples randomly-generated training levels, as UED. We argue that by curating completely random levels, PLR, too, can generate novel and complex levels for effective training. This insight reveals a natural class of UED methods we call Dual Curriculum Design (DCD). Crucially, DCD includes both PLR and a popular UED algorithm, PAIRED, as special cases and inherits similar theoretical guarantees. This connection allows us to develop novel theory for PLR, providing a version with a robustness guarantee at Nash equilibria. Furthermore, our theory suggests a highly counterintuitive improvement to PLR: by stopping the agent from updating its policy on uncurated levels (training on less data), we can improve the convergence to Nash equilibria. Indeed, our experiments confirm that our new method, PLR\u22a5, obtains better results on a suite of out-of-distribution, zero-shot transfer tasks, in addition to demonstrating that PLR\u22a5 improves the performance of PAIRED, from which it inherited its theoretical framework.","authors":"Minqi Jiang|Michael Dennis|Jack Parker-Holder|Jakob Foerster|Edward Grefenstette|Tim Rockt\u00e4schel","keywords":"reinforcement learning|generalization|curriculum learning|environment design|procedural content generation","proceedings":"NeurIPS","title":"Replay-Guided Adversarial Environment Design","type":"Conference","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02439","year":2021},{"UID":"jiang2020prioritized","abstract":"Simulated environments with procedurally generated content have become popular benchmarks for testing systematic generalization of reinforcement learning agents.

Fixed sets of training levels can be determined to aid comparison and reproducibility, and test levels can be held out to evaluate the generalization and robustness of agents. While prior work samples training levels in a direct way (e.g. uniformly) for the agent to learn from, we investigate the hypothesis that different levels provide different learning progress for an agent at specific times during training. We introduce Prioritized Level Replay, a general framework for estimating the future learning potential of a level given the current state of the agent's policy. We find that temporal-difference (TD) errors, while previously used to selectively sample past transitions, also prove effective for scoring a level's future learning potential when the agent replays (that is, revisits) that level to generate entirely new episodes of experiences from it.

Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) exacerbates matters by imposing various constraints on communication and observability. In this work, we consider the fundamental hurdle affecting both value-based and policy-gradient approaches: an exponential blowup of the action space with the number of agents. For value-based methods, it poses challenges in accurately representing the optimal value function. For policy gradient methods, it makes training the critic difficult and exacerbates the problem of the lagging critic. We show that from a learning theory perspective, both problems can be addressed by accurately representing the associated action-value function with a low-complexity hypothesis class. This requires accurately modelling the agent interactions in a sample efficient way. To this end, we propose a novel tensorised formulation of the Bellman equation. This gives rise to our method Tesseract, which views the Q-function as a tensor whose modes correspond to the action spaces of different agents. Algorithms derived from Tesseract decompose the Q-tensor across agents and utilise low-rank tensor approximations to model agent interactions relevant to the task. We provide PAC analysis for Tesseract-based algorithms and highlight their relevance to the class of rich observation MDPs. Empirical results in different domains confirm Tesseract's gains in sample efficiency predicted by the theory.","authors":"Anuj Mahajan|Mikayel Samvelyan|Lei Mao|Viktor Makoviychuk|Animesh Garg|Jean Kossaifi|Shimon Whiteson|Yuke Zhu|Animashree Anandkumar","keywords":"reinforcement learning|multi-agent learning","proceedings":"ICML","title":"Tesseract: Tensorised Actors for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning","type":"Conference","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00136","year":2021},{"UID":"niepert2021imle","abstract":"Combining discrete probability distributions and combinatorial optimization problems with neural network components has numerous applications but poses several challenges.
