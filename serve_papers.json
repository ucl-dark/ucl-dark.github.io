By connecting the RL workflow to the advanced functionality enabled by modern web standards, GriddlyJS allows publishing interactive agent-environment demos that reproduce experimental results directly to the web. To demonstrate the versatility of GriddlyJS, we use it to quickly develop a complex compositional puzzle-solving environment alongside arbitrary human-designed environment configurations and their solutions for use in a automatic curriculum learning and offline RL context.

Using a state-conditional Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), TAP models the conditional distribution of the trajectories given the current state. When deployed as an RL agent, TAP avoids planning step-by-step in a high-dimensional continuous action space but instead looks for the optimal latent code sequences by beam search. Unlike O(D^3) complexity of Trajectory Transformer, TAP enjoys constant O(C) planning computational complexity regarding state-action dimensionality D. Our empirical evaluation also shows the increasingly strong performance of TAP with the growing dimensionality.

A promising avenue for improving the robustness of RL agents is through the use of curricula. One such class of methods frames environment design as a game between a student and a teacher, using regret-based objectives to produce environment instantiations (or levels) at the frontier of the student agent's capabilities. These methods benefit from their generality, with theoretical guarantees at equilibrium, yet they often struggle to find effective levels in challenging design spaces. By contrast, evolutionary approaches seek to incrementally alter environment complexity, resulting in potentially open-ended learning, but often rely on domain-specific heuristics and vast amounts of computational resources. In this paper we propose to harness the power of evolution in a principled, regret-based curriculum. Our approach, which we call Adversarially Compounding Complexity by Editing Levels (ACCEL), seeks to constantly produce levels at the frontier of an agent's capabilities, resulting in curricula that start simple but become increasingly complex.

As is commonly observed, such natural systems are flexible to changes in their structure. Specifically, they exhibit a high degree of generalization when the abilities or the total number of agents changes within a system. We term this phenomenon as Combinatorial Generalization (CG). CG is a highly desirable trait for autonomous systems as it can increase their utility and deployability across a wide range of applications. While recent works addressing specific aspects of CG have shown impressive results on complex domains, they provide no performance guarantees when generalizing towards novel situations. In this work, we shed light on the theoretical underpinnings of CG for cooperative multi-agent systems (MAS). Specifically, we study generalization bounds under a linear dependence of the underlying dynamics on the agent capabilities, which can be seen as a generalization of Successor Features to MAS. We then extend the results first for Lipschitz and then arbitrary dependence of rewards on team capabilities.

Here, we cast Prioritized Level Replay (PLR), an empirically successful but theoretically unmotivated method that selectively samples randomly-generated training levels, as UED. We argue that by curating completely random levels, PLR, too, can generate novel and complex levels for effective training. This insight reveals a natural class of UED methods we call Dual Curriculum Design (DCD). Crucially, DCD includes both PLR and a popular UED algorithm, PAIRED, as special cases and inherits similar theoretical guarantees. This connection allows us to develop novel theory for PLR, providing a version with a robustness guarantee at Nash equilibria. Furthermore, our theory suggests a highly counterintuitive improvement to PLR: by stopping the agent from updating its policy on uncurated levels (training on less data), we can improve the convergence to Nash equilibria. Indeed, our experiments confirm that our new method, PLR\u22a5, obtains better results on a suite of out-of-distribution, zero-shot transfer tasks, in addition to demonstrating that PLR\u22a5 improves the performance of PAIRED, from which it inherited its theoretical framework.","authors":"Minqi Jiang|Michael Dennis|Jack Parker-Holder|Jakob Foerster|Edward Grefenstette|Tim Rockt\u00e4schel","keywords":"reinforcement learning|generalisation|curriculum learning|environment design","proceedings":"NeurIPS","title":"Replay-Guided Adversarial Environment Design","type":"Conference","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02439","year":2021},{"UID":"jiang2020prioritized","abstract":"Simulated environments with procedurally generated content have become popular benchmarks for testing systematic generalization of reinforcement learning agents.

Fixed sets of training levels can be determined to aid comparison and reproducibility, and test levels can be held out to evaluate the generalization and robustness of agents.

Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) exacerbates matters by imposing various constraints on communication and observability.

For value-based methods, it poses challenges in accurately representing the optimal value function. For policy gradient methods, it makes training the critic difficult and exacerbates the problem of the lagging critic. We show that from a learning theory perspective, both problems can be addressed by accurately representing the associated action-value function with a low-complexity hypothesis class.

This gives rise to our method Tesseract, which views the Q-function as a tensor whose modes correspond to the action spaces of different agents. Algorithms derived from Tesseract decompose the Q-tensor across agents and utilise low-rank tensor approximations to model agent interactions relevant to the task.
